# ðŸŽ‰Oh, hi there!

`{Introduction}`

My name is Marky, aka __SwiftNCloak__. I am an computer science student from the Philippines who is aspiring to become a software engineer. I plan to build apps that would help with people's needs one day, and be revolutionary, and make games that would really be enjoyable. 

```js
let statement = "Welcome, game changer!";
console.log(statement);
```
